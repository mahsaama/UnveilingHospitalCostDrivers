     Currently, the forecasting of healthcare costs is of significant importance for the finance management of both government and individual citizens. However, the existence of dramatic individual diversity in health status, as well as the extensive complexity of the factors influencing the cost, has made the prediction a challenging task. Thanks to the unprecedented adoption of mobile devices, regular individuals may contribute diverse dimensions of data for the medical cost prediction. Hospitals and healthcare service providers are all setting up their own mobile services and collect user data for analysis. Previous methods usually employed traditional machine learning or simple neural network methods, which are difficult to be applied to the nonlinear medical cost and diverse dimensions of data. Therefore, this paper proposes a multitask learning-based framework for interpretable medical cost interval prediction to address these issues. The framework proposed in this paper first predicts subcost intervals by applying the multidimensional data collected from mobile ends and following the multitask learning paradigm. The total cost interval is then predicted based on this prediction. Simultaneously, the framework derives a decision tree from the parameters of the multitask learning network and calculates the importance of each feature in predicting the cost intervals. This paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness using real-world data experiments.

     There is strong interest among healthcare payers to identify emerging healthcare cost drivers to support early intervention. However, many challenges arise in analyzing large, high dimensional, and noisy healthcare data. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach that utilizes hierarchical search strategies and enhanced statistical process control (SPC) algorithms to surface high impact cost drivers. Our approach aims to provide interpretable, detailed, and actionable insights of detected change patterns attributing to multiple clinical factors. We also proposed an algorithm to identify comparable treatment offsets at the population level and quantify the cost impact on their utilization changes. To illustrate our approach, we apply it to the IBM Watson Health MarketScan Commercial Database and organized the detected emerging drivers into 5 categories for reporting. We also discuss some findings in this analysis and potential actions in mitigating the impact of the drivers.

     There is strong interest among payers to identify emerging healthcare cost drivers to support early intervention. However, many challenges arise in analyzing large, high dimensional, and noisy healthcare data. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach that utilizes hierarchical and multi-resolution search strategies using enhanced statistical process control (SPC) algorithms to surface high impact cost drivers. Our approach aims to provide interpretable, detailed, and actionable insights of detected change patterns attributing to multiple demographic and clinical factors. We also proposed an algorithm to identify comparable treatment offsets at the population level and quantify the cost impact on their utilization changes.
