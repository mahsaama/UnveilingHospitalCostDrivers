# Unveiling Hospital Cost Drivers

Goal
------------
 Explainable and Agentic AI Approach for Unveiling Hospital Cost Drivers

Project Description
-------------
Hospitals across regions exhibit significant variability in inpatient costs, influenced by different
factors such as the use of advanced medical devices, regional economic disparities, specialized
surgical procedures, and patient demographics. Understanding these cost drivers is important for
policymakers, healthcare administrators, and stakeholders aiming to optimize healthcare
expenditures without compromising quality. This project seeks to use Explainable AI techniques to
identify and interpret the primary factors contributing to elevated inpatient costs. Subsequently,
leveraging Agentic AI, the project aims to simulate potential interventions, like adopting cost-effective
technologies or reallocating resources, to assess their impact on cost reduction and care quality.

Research Questions
---------
- What are the primary factors influencing total inpatient costs across New York State hospitals?
- How do regional characteristics, hospital specializations, and patient demographics contribute to
cost variations?
- Can Agentic AI simulations identify effective strategies for hospitals to optimize costs without
compromising care quality?

Tasks
-------
- Preprocess data, ensuring accurate mapping of costs, procedures, and hospital attributes.
- Develop predictive models to estimate inpatient costs, incorporating variables like procedures, diagnoses, etc.
- Apply XAI techniques to interpret model outputs and identify significant cost drivers.
- Design an Agentic AI framework to simulate interventions (e.g., adopting cost-effective devices, modifying surgical
protocols) and predict their impact on overall costs.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize findings, model interpretations, and simulation results.


Expected Outcome
------
- An interpretable model highlighting key factors contributing to high inpatient costs.
- Agentic AI simulations proposing actionable strategies for cost reduction.
- A web interface dashboard facilitating exploration of cost drivers and potential interventions.


Data
------
- Detailed records of hospital inpatient discharges in New York State (SPARCS dataset)
- Over 2.3 million inpatient discharge entries
- Includes patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, hospital identifiers, length of stay, and total charges
- De-identified and publicly accessible
